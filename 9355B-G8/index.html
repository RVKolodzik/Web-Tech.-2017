		<p>&emsp;Corruption is an action committed by officers in the government by abusing the powers
			that was entrusted to them by the people. It is usually the cause of poverty, which eventually
			leads the people to think that the country’s political and economic system is unreliable and
			cannot be trusted.

			&emsp;People always wants something, something better, BIGGER than what others have, Jealousy. 
			People tend to go to where their satisfactions are satisfied, being self-centered. 
			They always want to be on top of everyone, having the power.
			Without having the mentality of who and for what you are serving for, there will always be corruption, 
			and we will never alleviate it.<br><br>

			&emsp;Immediate process are needed in our justice system to have profound effect. It will be irrelevant when
			the dispute of sentence due is late to its incapacity to provide solutions within the time-frame.
			The crime committed is nearly forgotten, by the time the sentence is out. Justice needs honest and guaranteed
			processes, but not if it is slowing down the processes in the administration of justice.<br><br>

			&emsp;A persons feeling undervalued and not paid correctly cause corruption in public service. This then
			leads to that person feeling the right to get what is not his to compensate for that feeling of undervaluation
			Lack of regulations and implementations regarding the fight for corruption may also be a cause of it 
			since it merely encourages people to be corrupt with the mindset that they will get away with it.
			One of the most recognizable cause of corruption is greed. People seek power, wealth, fame and attention
			for their own interest. They want supremacy, control and the largest part on everything. We cannot deny 
			that when we experience power and fortune, we tend to enjoy it and we tend to abuse it. The more we have 
			it, the more we want it. The more we want it, the more we seek for it, and the more we seek for it, the more
			we find ways to gain it. It’s already our nature as human beings that we never get contented. 
			We always seek for more, and we always work for more. We should be reminded that the more power and wealth
			we experience, the more vulnerable we are to temptations. We might come into a point where we do something
			for our self and it causes the expense of others.<br><br>
		</p>

		<p id="cause4">
			&emsp;Greed is very powerful. It drives us to do something in order to gain and achieve what we want. 
			It makes us invulnerable to fear. It makes us happy by awarding us with the satisfaction of knowing
			that we have more than what we need. It makes us very competitive by pushing us to gain more than what
			other people has. It tells us that we should go above and beyond other people’s level.
			It makes us believe in our self and be confident on our own knowledge and opinion, it teaches us not listen<
			to others. Greediness is very powerful. It kills dreams, it kills hope, it kills self-respect, and it kills futures.
			Greed fuels evil desires.  It feeds selfishness. And it starts corruption.

			&emsp;The world has been being infesting by the biggest disease, corruption. A vast loss of money was greatest problem 
			faced by the people. It has ingrained hopelessness and discouragement and threatens the strength of loyalty that has 
			been built through century.
			The people start to disregard the accused involved in the corruption by negatively thinking about him. 
			But when they work together they will again approach them by thinking that they would have benefits provided. 
			People build distrust towards officials. Lower officer will be dishonest and disrespectful to their higher up. 
			The lower grade officer may not obey the orders of higher grade officer.
			Constitutional republic is a type of government which officers are elected. The people elected the official were based
			on their belief in him. But when they found he is involved in corruption people may lose faith in them.

			&emsp;Have you encountered a student paying his teacher just to have a higher grade? Or, in a company, that only promote people who perform personal favors for their boss? All of these are example of corruption. What is the first thing that comes into your mind when you see the word corruption? Of course, all of us has this thought of political corruption as what we’ve seen and experienced in our daily life. But, what is the real meaning of corruption? It has many different meaning for us. Corruption is an unconscionable advantage, profit or gain of injustice through the abuse of authority and power (Ubani 2016). In other words, it is the misuse of an entrusted power for private or personal gain. It is not healthy for a country to have corruption.  Is corruption bad for humans? Yes, of course, because it violates human rights, and dispose justice. It affects people, society and the economy. People will have lack of quality in service, and justice will no longer be experienced by many. Society may become weak because of the frustration, apathy and lack of trust in the rulers. People may not even respect the officials of the government. Corruption also discourages people to work together in common good. It demands bribery, social inequality, poverty and insecurity. While in economy, it has a great possibility that the foreign investments will decrease. It leads to the depletion of national wealth, and unbalanced economic development. How can we avoid corruption? The first tool is “education.” We must be educated to be aware and understand what corruption is, and to fully know our rights as a human being. Also, we need to reform the government process and finance management. Promoting transparency, openness and professional accountability is also one of the solution. And lastly, empower the citizens. Our voice is the powerful tool that can help this corruption to vanish. Strengthening citizens demand for anti-corruption and empowering them to hold government accountable is a sustainable approach that helps to build mutual trust between citizens and government. As a voice of the many, be a fighter of corruption and do not follow dirty acts not only of the government, but also of some people who can be the root of corruption. You can start the fight within yourself. Be the change that the world wants and others will learn a lot from you and will follow you. Now, be the change!

			&emsp;The Philippines; Our nation, known for its beautiful beaches, hospitable people, and diverse natural resources. To those looking for a cheap place to travel, this is the destination. Our country has great potential.  However, there is more to what lies beyond the surface. Millions of Filipinos suffer from corruption every day. Year after year, we ask: when will poverty be alleviated?  One of the big factors that contributes to poverty in Philippines is corruption, a problem that doesn’t seem to end. Because of these corruptions, funds are getting short for health, education, agriculture, and other important matters. Poverty in the Philippines seems to be a normal thing. Seeing men, women, and children living in the slums as we go to work or school has become a normal sight to our eyes.  
			According to a 2014 report by Global Financial Integrity, the Philippines lost about $410.5 billion between 1960 and 2011 on illicit financial flow. In current exchange rates, the amount is about P19.34 trillion (without accounting for inflation). The vast majority of money flowing illegally into and out of the Philippines over the 52-year time span was done mostly through misinvoicing of trade. In effect, the P19.34 trillion lost to corruption could have been used for education, health or infrastructure. What happened to the Pearl of the Orient Sea? We have wasted so many years trying to make a change and yet nothing has happened. Each administration has been nothing but failure and more issues about corruption. It saddens me, as an individual of the youth that my parents and all other employees like them, have to pay taxes and see not progress at all. 	
			We, as Filipino citizens, live in a country where deception and lies prevail. For those who are part of the Class E or people who reside in squatter areas, these numbers do not mean anything to them. They have been so used to this kind of lifestyle, that it has become comfortable. Although, the thought of being better off isn’t gone, they have accepted the truth.  
		</p>

		<p id="column3">
			&emsp;Corruption is very rampant and we would always like to get rid of this problem, but whenever we do issue this problem, we may face dangerous situations. 
			It’s sad to say that our country was once one of the top countries in Asia that has economic power, and look at us now. Corruption is one of the major problems in our country. It’s evident that even if government tells us that they are not corrupt, we can still feel it and that we can even see it happening in our everyday lives and it drags our country down. Low-quality roads, schools, hospitals, and other public facilities, and even wealthy government officials. 
			Corruption is not just tied to governments stealing the people’s money for their own personal wealth, it can also be abuse of power and authority bestowed upon them. The civil code of the Philippines Principle of Abuse or Rights Article 19 even states that “Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due and observe honesty and good faith.” This means that we are all subjected to practice this principle, both us, the people, and the politicians seated in the government. Our time can also be corrupted by the government. Time is precious and as many of us would say, “Time is money.” Projects that was planned by the government, especially buildings and roads and their specifications such as the time it should be finished are sometimes not given to us. Implementing this projects sometimes takes a very long time that should’ve been finished for just a short period of time and this can cause lots of money. Tax is also one cause of corruption in our country and sometimes government evades this. Our tax is supposedly for the public, meaning everyone in the country is included. Tax is supposedly good for the country, since it’s our ways and means of making our country better, but since there are people who are tax evaders, government misusing our tax, until this day, how can we even make our very own country better? Sometimes tax can even be too high for the average person, which can lead to poverty. 
			Corruption is a very hard topic to talk about, but when I put myself into the shoes of those having a difficult time dealing with this problem, it really saddens me to see that our country is not excelling with this kinds of situation. We should not be afraid to put the big cases to the court. We should always remember that if we do want to make our country a better place, it is us who has the voice. We need to devise our systems and use our laws fairer. We need to fill the gap between the people and the government. Although we have a long way to probably achieve this goal, but it is never too late to make a change and make a difference.

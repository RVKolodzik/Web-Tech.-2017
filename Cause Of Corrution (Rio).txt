	People always wants something, something better, BIGGER than what others have, Jealousy. People tend to 
go to where their satisfactions are satisfied, being self-centered. They always want to be on top of everyone, having the power.
Without having the mentality of who and for what you are serving for, there will always be corruption, and
we will never alleviate it.

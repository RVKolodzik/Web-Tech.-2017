Greed
By: Jason Paul M. Dadula

One of the most recognizable cause of corruption is greed. People seek power, wealth, fame and attention for their own interest. They want supremacy, control and the largest part on everything. We cannot deny that when we experience power and fortune, we tend to enjoy it and we tend to abuse it. The more we have it, the more we want it. The more we want it, the more we seek for it, and the more we seek for it, the more we find ways to gain it. It’s already our nature as human beings that we never get contented. We always seek for more, and we always work for more. We should be reminded that the more power and wealth we experience, the more vulnerable we are to temptations. We might come into a point where we do something for our self and it causes the expense of others.

Greed is very powerful. It drives us to do something in order to gain and achieve what we want. It makes us invulnerable to fear. It makes us happy by awarding us with the satisfaction of knowing that we have more than what we need. It makes us very competitive by pushing us to gain more than what other people has. It tells us that we should go above and beyond other people’s level. It makes us believe in our self and be confident on our own knowledge and opinion, it teaches us not listen to others. Greediness is very powerful. It kills dreams, it kills hope, it kills self-respect, and it kills futures.

Greed fuels evil desires.  It feeds selfishness. And it starts corruption.

DESCRIPTIONS:
	The graphs shows that the Philippines was ones a country where corruption wasn't that much of an issue, but is still present in the country. As time progresses after 1995 where the Philippines ranked 36 overall out of 175 countries; corruption began rise and become a problem for the country until 2008 where the country was ranked 141 the highest corruption rank the Philippines experienced. Thankfully after 2008, our global rank for corruption began to drop down until 2014 when it ranked 85, although it might still be high for some, at least the country saw a glimpse of good governance during that timeframe. It became to rise again after 2014. And as of 2016, the Philippines ranked 101.
